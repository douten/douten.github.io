          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a passion for building innovative and
            user-friendly applications. I have experience in various programming
            languages and frameworks, and I enjoy tackling complex problems with
            creative solutions. I am always eager to learn new technologies and
            improve my skills. I believe in the power of collaboration and
            open-source software, and I enjoy contributing to projects that make
            a positive impact on the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I like to explore new programming languages, work
            on personal projects, and share my knowledge with others through
            blogging and mentoring. I am currently looking for new opportunities
            to work on exciting projects that challenge me and help me grow as a
            developer.

          <p>
            Yapa is a minimal podomoro timer to help you focus on your tasks.
            Build your custom set of timers with names and colors. It features a
            simple timer without showing the elapsed time, so you can focus on
            the task at hand.
